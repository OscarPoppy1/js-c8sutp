    <p>We have read many customer feedback and comments on <a href="https://essaywritingservices.review/reviews/mypaperwriter-review">mypaperwriter.com reviews</a> as well as reviews on other sites. These comments were not as encouraging as the testimonials on the site. There were several concerns, including poor writing quality, slow responses from writers, particularly with revisions, as well as resources that didn't meet academic standards.

      Although the company claims that all writers are natives of the United States or the UK, we believe this is not true. We ordered a research paper that included word usage and writing errors typical of ESL writers.
      
      Although MyPaperWriter.com is not BBB-certified, we can tell you from our own experiences that this company isn't a fraud or a scam.
      
      High Quality Customer Support
      Customers and guests can reach customer service by phone or via live chat. The results of a chat we initiated to discuss dissertation writing were disappointing. The rep didn't seem to have any knowledge about dissertations or that they were a culminating project for a Masterâ€™s (UK) and Ph.D. (U.S.). When we asked him if a complete dissertation could have been written in 10 days, he replied "yes". He didn't change his mind when we told him that the dissertation had to be original research and approximately 150 pages long.
      
      MyPaperWriter.com uses an answering service, or needs to better train its staff.
      
      Another concern is the lack of written policies on the site. Customers don't know what their rights are.
      
      Get Discounts and Prices
      MyPaperWriter's prices are very high in this industry. High school pieces start at $17.55 per page with 15+ days to complete the deadline. The academic level and deadline requirements of the student determine their graduation. Professional level students can earn up to $47.73. Standard and premium writing options are available to business customers. However, the prices can be high. No discount code or coupon code was found for new customers. There are no discounts or coupon codes that can be used to get special pricing for loyal customers.
